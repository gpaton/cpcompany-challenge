# C.P. Company Challenge

French youtuber [@BenjaminCode](https://www.youtube.com/@BenjaminCode) proposed a [frontend creative coding challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7-ERpRj3z8).
The goal is to code this design template in HTML/CSS with a bit of animation.

As a PHP/Symfony backend developer, this is an opportunity for me to begin my journey as a Full stack developer.

So even if it took me more than an hour, I wanted to share the result anyway. In a few years, it will reminds me my first steps :-)

You may check the source code in this repository and the result on my [website](https://guillaumepaton.fr/cpcompany-challenge).
